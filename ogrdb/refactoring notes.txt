All routes (except possibly some maintenance related routes) should end up in a directory under here, with an import
in app.py.

All files generated by build_from_schema should, for the time being, stay where they are:
- templates need to stay in /templates becuase they are served from there
- db files need to stay in a central place because they are, by and large, referred to widely
- forms *could* be moved: their path is specified in build_from_schema so it wouldn't be too hard. Maybe later.

All manually generated files apart from templates, in particular the table-building code in forms, should move into
the directories under here, with their route.
