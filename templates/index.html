    <h3>Welcome to OGRDB - the Online Germline Receptor Database!</h3>

    <p>In recent years it has become possible to sequence immune receptor repertoires at great depth. The accurate analysis of these
    repertoires requires a comprehensive understanding of the germline genes that underpin them. </p>

    <p>Even for well-studied species such as humans, mice and rats, our knowledge of these 'germline libraries' is incomplete.
    Determining the library from the genome using traditional methods is technically challenging, because of the
    presence of many similar sequences and repeats. More recently, methods have been developed
    to infer novel sequences and alleles from sequenced repertoires.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.antibodysociety.org/airrc/">Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire (AIRR) Community</a> was formed
    to promote and share good practice in adaptive immune repertoire sequencing.  It has formed an Inferred Allele Review Committee (IARC) to evaluate inferred
    alleles for inclusion in the relevant germline libraries. IARC's work is outlined in more detail in a <a href="/static/docs/IARC_Surrey.pdf">recent poster</a>,
    which was presented at a Systems Immunology Workshop at the University of Surrey, England, in March 2018.
    IARC has worked, together with colleagues at IMGT and the US National Institute of Health, to agree a review process. OGRDB
    supports that process, and will also provide a record of affirmed sequences. Affirmed sequences will be listed under the Sequences tab above, and the submissions that
        underpin them will be found under the Submissions tab. You can make your own submissions by following the steps below.</p>

    <p>As a first step, IARC is now ready to review submissions of inferred human genes and alleles. These sequences may be novel, or may
    extend incomplete sequences currently in the IMGT set. Researchers interested in submitting sequences should:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Review the <a href="/render_page/iarc_guidelines.html">IARC guidelines</a> and verify that their methods and datasets are in conformance.</li>
    <li>Submit sequence and data to Genbank or ENA, following the <a href="https://github.com/airr-community/airr-standards/blob/ogre/docs/ogre/iarc_submission_ncbi.rst">Genbank/ENA Workflow</a>.</li>
    <li>Submit the inferred sequences to IARC via OGRDB, following the <a href="/render_page/ogre_guide.html">OGRDB Submission Guide</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It is hoped to open the review process to a wider range of species shortly.</p>
