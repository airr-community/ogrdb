,Key to Genotype Fields,

,,
,Number of sequences': where sequences are counted the count should be conducted after quality control UMI processing and replicate/error cloud removal.,
,Reference genes and alleles' - this is the set of genes and alleles provided to the inference tool.,
,,
,Field,description
,sequence_id,"Identifier of the allele (either IMGT, or the name assigned by the submitter to an inferred gene) "
,sequences,Overall number of sequences assigned to this allele
,closest_reference,"For inferred alleles, the closest reference gene and allele, as inferred by the tool"
,closest_host,"For inferred alleles, the closest reference gene and allele that is in the subject's inferred genotype, as inferred by the tool"
,nt_diff,"For inferred alleles, the number of nucleotides that differ between this sequence and the closest reference gene and allele"
,nt_substitutions,"For inferred alleles,  comma-separated list of nucleotide substitutions (e.g. G112A) between this sequence and the closest reference gene and allele.  Please use IMGT numbering for V-genes, and number from start of coding sequence for D- or J- genes."
,aa_diff,"For inferred alleles, the number of amino acids that differ between this sequence and the closest reference gene and allele"
,aa_substitutions,"For inferred alleles, the list of amino acid substitutions (e.g. A96N) between this sequence and the closest reference gene and allele. Please use IMGT numbering for V-genes, and number from start of coding sequence for D- or J- genes."
,unmutated_frequency,"The number of sequences exactly matching this sequence divided by the number of sequences exactly matching any allele of any gene, *100"
,unmutated_sequences,The number of records in the sequence dataset exactly matching this unmutated sequence 
,unmutated_umis,The number of molecules (identified by Unique Molecular Identifiers) exactly matching this unmutated sequence (if UMIs were used)
,allelic_percentage,"The number of sequences exactly matching the sequence of this allele divided by the number of sequences exactly matching any allele of this specific gene, *100"
,unique_ds,"For inferred alleles, the number of D allele calls (i.e., unique allelic sequences) found associated with the inferred sequence"
,unique_js,"For inferred alleles, the number of J allele calls (i.e., unique allelic sequences) found associated with the inferred sequence"
,unique_cdr3s,Number of unique CDR3s found associated with an inferred V sequence
,haplotyping_locus,"For inferred alleles,  the locus (or loci) from which haplotyping was inferred (e.g. IGHJ6)"
,haplotyping_ratio,"For inferred alleles, the ratio (expressed as two percentages) with which the two inferred haplotypes were found (e.g. 60:40)"
,nt_sequence,The consensus sequence provided by the inference tool
